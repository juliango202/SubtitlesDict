## Subtitles for testing

To test jijimaku we can use TED talks as they are freely available and usually subtitled in many languages.

Currently I use [david_gallo_shows_underwater_astonishments](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_gallo_shows_underwater_astonishments).

To download subtitles in SRT format, you can use [ted2srt.org](https://ted2srt.org/).
