1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,796
We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea,

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,796
and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,501
knows that for about two and half hours on the way down,

4
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:24,220
it's a perfectly positively pitch-black world.

5
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:27,236
And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,623
that you couldn't describe:

7
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:32,246
these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,403
Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association --

9
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:38,186
was able to come up with a camera

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,696
that could capture some of these incredible animals,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,096
and that's what you're seeing here on the screen.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,013
That's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies.

13
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,292
There's a flying turkey under a tree.

14
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:49,326
(Laughter)

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,498
I'm a geologist by training.

16
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:53,974
But I love that.

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,249
And you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten,

18
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,796
some they use to attract prey,

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,571
but all of it, from an artistic point of view,

20
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,996
is just positively amazing.

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,796
And a lot of what goes on inside --

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,154
There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.

23
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:10,796
Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize,

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,280
these lovely patterns.

25
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,796
And then this last one,

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,796
one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,796
Just absolutely amazing, every single dive.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,883
That's the unknown world, and today we've only explored

29
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,633
about 3 percent of what's out there in the ocean.

30
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:29,263
Already we've found the world's highest mountains,

31
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:30,796
the world's deepest valleys,

32
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,897
underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --

33
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,207
a lot of that we shared with you from the stage.

34
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:37,896
And in a place where we thought no life at all,

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,496
we find more life, we think, and diversity and density

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,003
than the tropical rainforest,

37
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:45,052
which tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all.

38
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:46,405
There's still 97 percent,

39
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,530
and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises.

40
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:51,605
But I want to jump up to shallow water now

41
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,315
and look at some creatures that are positively amazing.

42
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,896
Cephalopods -- head-foots.

43
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,172
As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.

44
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,273
(Laughter)

45
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:01,496
This is an octopus.

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,697
This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab,

47
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:06,896
and it's just fascinating how cephalopods can,

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,474
with their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings,

49
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:11,274
look at light, look at patterns.

50
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,796
Here's an octopus moving across the reef,

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,621
finds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background.

52
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,546
Tough thing to do.

53
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:23,096
In the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,793
Now males, when they fight,

55
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,994
if they're really aggressive, they turn white.

56
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,596
And these two males are fighting.

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,693
They do it by bouncing their butts together,

58
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,337
which is an interesting concept.

59
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,096
Now, here's a male on the left and a female on the right,

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,796
and the male has managed to split his coloration

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,873
so the female only always sees the kinder, gentler squid in him.

62
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:44,796
(Laughter)

63
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,796
Let's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration:

64
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,796
white on the right, brown on the left.

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,531
He takes a step back,

66
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:56,269
he's keeping off the other males by splitting his body,

67
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,996
and comes up on the other side --

68
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,084
Bingo!

69
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:02,161
Now, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males,

70
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,435
but I don't know.

71
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,796
(Laughter)

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,718
Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.

73
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:08,606
This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.

74
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,102
And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.

75
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,058
But they can do pretty amazing things, too.

76
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,796
Here we're going to see one backing into a crevice,

77
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,796
and watch his tentacles --

78
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,796
he just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.

79
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,994
Disappears right into the background.

80
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,487
Positively amazing.

81
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,911
Here's two males fighting.

82
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:31,396
Once again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods;

83
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,996
they know not to hurt each other.

84
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,896
But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,796
That's an amazing thing.

86
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,616
Here's an octopus.

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,072
Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move,

88
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:44,606
because predators can see them.

89
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,706
This guy can make himself look like a rock,

90
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,906
and, looking at his environment,

91
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,925
can actually slide across the bottom,

92
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,926
using the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen.

93
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,263
His motion blends right into the background --

94
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,320
the moving rock trick.

95
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:03,096
So, we're learning lots new from the shallow water.

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,297
Still exploring the deep, but learning lots from the shallow water.

97
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:07,584
There's a good reason why:

98
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,520
the shallow water's full of predators -- here's a barracuda --

99
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:12,596
and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,

100
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,796
you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,597
In the next scene, you're going to see a nice coral bottom.

102
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:20,661
And you see that an octopus would stand out

103
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,268
very easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage,

104
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:25,393
use your skin to change color and texture.

105
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,796
Here's some algae in the foreground --

106
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,571
and an octopus.

107
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,995
Ain't that amazing?

108
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:37,796
Now, Roger spooked him, so he took off in a cloud of ink,

109
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,796
and when he lands, the octopus says, "Oh, I've been seen.

110
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,297
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."

111
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,796
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,797
So, he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards.

113
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,397
I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.

114
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,082
I thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse.

115
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:55,296
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,996
Just an amazing animal, it can change color and texture

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,354
to match the surroundings.

118
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:01,796
Watch him blend right into this algae.

119
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,796
One, two, three.

120
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,561
(Applause)

121
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:12,561
And now he's gone, and so am I. Thank you very much.

122
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:15,585
(Applause)
