# Optional: Name of the dictionary file used to source words definitions
# When not specified the program will use the first valid dictionary file it finds
# The dictionary can be either in JIJI format => https://github.com/juliango202/jiji
# Or a Lingoes LD2 dictionary => http://www.lingoes.net/en/dictionary/
#dictionary: jmdict_english.jiji.yaml

# Optional: Source language of the dictionary
# This can be used for LD2 dictionaries if language detection fails
# dictionaryLanguage: French

# Optional: Dictionary definitions cleanup regexp
# Everything that matches this regexp in a dictionary definition will be removed before display.
# This can be used (especially for LD2 dictionaries) to keep the definitions short by getting rid of
# grammar info, example sentences, etc..
# dictionaryCleanupRegexp: (example).*

# Font-size to use when writing dictionary definitions
# A low resolution video will need a higher font-size, and vice-versa
definitionSize: 9

# List of colors to use successively to highlight the defined words in a subtitle caption.
# For challenging subtitles with a lot of unknown words, it helps to highlight words
# in different colors to make parsing easier and to read definitions quickly.
# For "easy" subtitles with relatively few unknown words it's probably better to
# use only white(#FFFFFF) so you can practice parsing naturally.
highlightColors:
- '#FFAAAA'
- '#AAAAFF'
- '#AAFFAA'
- '#FFAAFF'
- '#AAFFFF'

# The list of PartOfSpeech to annotate
# The subtitle words with a detected PartOfSpeech NOT in this list will be ignored
# See http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/all.html for the possible values
# The default is to display definitions for NOUN, VERB, ADJ, and ADV
partOfSpeechToAnnotate:
- NOUN
- VERB
- ADJ
- ADV

# Flag to display all lemmas of a defined word or not.
# When a dictionary definition is associated with several lemmas(e.g. アップデート, アップデイト),
# you can set this option to true to display them all
# otherwise set to false(default) to display only the lemma that appears in the caption
displayOtherLemma: false

# Ignore words if they have a specific tag in the dictionary
# Entries in a jiji dictionary can be tagged, and for all dictionaries there is also a list of default tags by language in the language-tags/ directory.
# For example the tags freq01 to freq12 are used to represent the frequency of the entry
# If you expect to already understand frequent words, you can put freq01, freq02, ... in the list below
# and the definition for those words won't be displayed
# NOTE: be conservative because frequency information is often missing and not always reliable
# Japanese tags when using JMdict are: kana-expr, freq01->freq12, jlpt1->jlpt5, and nfXX tags (copied from JMdict)
ignoreTags:
- freq01  # Ignore the ~400 most common words of the language (when the info is available in language-tags/ files)
- freq02  # Ignore the next ~600 most common words
- kana-expr   # (Japanese language only) kana-expr is for expressions made of successive hiragana tokens, they are usually grammar constructs that can be ignored.

# Ignore words in the list below
# You can put here the list of words that you don't want defined because you already know them
ignoreWords:
- あ
- ああ
